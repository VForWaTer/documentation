How does a typical workflow look like?

Usually you will follow a find-manipulate-visualize-download workflow.

1. **Find** a suitable dataset in your region of interest and scan through the different data types.
2. **Manipulate** the dataset in your personal workbench. Scale it to the resolution and extend you need. 
   Apply common tools to gain first insight into your dataset.
3. **Visualization** will foster and aid this process. V-FOR-WaTer offers a powerful and fully customizable visualization tool.
4. **Download** the new dataset into your preferred working environment. In case this is a Jupyter notebook, 
   the V-FOR-WaTer toolbox will be available, as well!
5. **Publish** your research done based on the downloaded dataset and don't forget to cite the dataset and V-FOR-WaTer ;)
