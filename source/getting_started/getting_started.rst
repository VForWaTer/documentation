Introduction
============

.. note::

    The Getting Started guide will quickly introduce the main features
    of the V-FOR-WaTer application and guide you through an easy example.

What is V-FOR-WaTer?
--------------------

V-FOR-WaTer will enable access to data and processes within one portal, with data provided from users and established data portals.
Yet the portal is still under construction and shows only time series data.
In production we will also over vector and raster data,
and the corresponding procces to work with data of different types.

Why should I use V-FOR-WaTer?
-----------------------------

1. Because it's awesome!
2. Processing your data in the V-FOR-WaTer portal is simple, fast and reproducible.

What does it cost?
------------------

It's free! Except of some Processes that need high performance computing.
The cost model for such processes will be announced later.

How does a typical workflow look like?
--------------------------------------

Usually you will follow a find-manipulate-visualize-download workflow.

1. **Find** a suitable dataset in your region of interest and scan through the different data types.
2. **Manipulate** the dataset in your personal workbench. Scale it to the resolution and extend you need. 
   Apply common tools to gain first insight into your dataset.
3. **Visualization** will foster and aid this process. V-FOR-WaTer offers a powerful and fully customizable visualization tool.
4. **Download** the new dataset into your preferred working environment. In case this is a Jupyter notebook, 
   the V-FOR-WaTer toolbox will be available, as well!
5. **Publish** your research done based on the downloaded dataset and don't forget to cite the dataset and V-FOR-WaTer ;)
