Using the workspace
==============

Overview
========
The centre of the workspace is dominated by a white space. In a future version, the user can drag and drop data and
tools in this area to build workflows, that can be saved and shared within the portal.

In the left sidebar are the datasets, that have been selected through the filter, and the results of the logged in user.

To the right are the tools that can be accessed. The colored icons on top of the tool indicate the types of the inputs
needed, the colored icons on the bottom of the tool button indicate the outputs.
To use the tool one has to click on it in the sidebar and a window opens in the middle of the screen. All mandatory
inputs are tagged with a star **(*)**. To run the tool click on ``Run`` on the bottom of the tool window.

When the color of the tool window changes to ``orange`` the process started successful and the window can be closed.
When the color of the tool window changes to ``red`` something went wrong. A message should help if the problem can be
solved on the users side. For other problems please contact the support team.

When the process starts a new button is created in the result area of the left sidebar. To check the status of the
process one can refresh the status by clicking the refresh button. A refresh of several running tools can be enforced
by reloading the website.

The refresh button changes after refresh to green when the process is finished, or to red in case of an error. More
information about the result can be accessed through the context menu, that can be accessed by clicking on the triangle
on the right of the button. The options there depend on the status and the type of the result.

The results can be downloaded or reused for other tools.
